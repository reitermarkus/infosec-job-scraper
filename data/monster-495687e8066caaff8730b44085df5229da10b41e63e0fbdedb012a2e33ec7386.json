The Division does this by establishing standards of safety for the protection of health, including standards for nuclear power plants and other nuclear installations and facilities, and by providing for the application of these standards through, among other things, support for the IAEA's Technical Cooperation programme, the rendering of safety review services, the promotion of education and training, the fostering of information exchange and the coordination of research and development. In addition, the Division helps ensure safety at nuclear installations by promulgating international safety instruments such as the Convention on Nuclear Safety and the Code of Conduct on the Safety of Research Reactors. NSNI comprises five Sections:</p><ul style=\"direction%3A+ltr%3B\"><li style=\"color%3A+rgb(0%2C+0%2C+0)%3B+font-style%3A+normal%3B+font-weight%3A+normal%3B\"><p>External Events Safety Section</p></li><li style=\"color%3A+rgb(0%2C+0%2C+0)%3B+font-style%3A+normal%3B+font-weight%3A+normal%3B\"><p>Operational Safety Section</p></li><li style=\"color%3A+rgb(0%2C+0%2C+0)%3B+font-style%3A+normal%3B+font-weight%3A+normal%3B\"><p>Safety Assessment Section</p></li><li style=\"color%3A+rgb(0%2C+0%2C+0)%3B+font-style%3A+normal%3B+font-weight%3A+normal%3B\"><p>Regulatory Activities Section</p></li><li style=\"color%3A+rgb(0%2C+0%2C+0)%3B+font-style%3A+normal%3B+font-weight%3A+normal%3B\"><p>Research Reactor Safety Section</p></li></ul><p>The External Events Safety Section (EESS) aims to strengthen Member States' capabilities to enhance the safety of nuclear installations through the proper selection of sites, assessment of site specific hazards and the utilization of site parameters in the design of the installation. EESS develops and implements safety standards and guides for design and safety assessment, methods and tools for deterministic and probabilistic safety analysis and safety performance evaluation for all external hazards considered in the design of a nuclear facility. The Section coordinates and supports Member States in establishing and implementing the engineering safety of installations and safety assessment and capacity building activities for embarking countries in the area of site and installation design safety, construction and operations.</p><p><b>Main Purpose</b></p><p>Develop technical documents in the field of hazard identification and site safety assessment for nuclear installations</p><p><b>Functions / Key Results Expected</b></p><p>The consultant shall:</p><ul style=\"direction%3A+ltr%3B\"><li style=\"color%3A+rgb(0%2C+0%2C+0)%3B+font-style%3A+normal%3B+font-weight%3A+normal%3B\"><p>Plan and lead technical meetings for the collection and analysis of practice in MS in areas as identified by the Donors of extrabudgetary contribution or by the EESS program and planning</p></li><li style=\"color%3A+rgb(0%2C+0%2C+0)%3B+font-style%3A+normal%3B+font-weight%3A+normal%3B\"><p>Finalize technical documents by merging contributions from External Experts and from discussion at the meetings; develop draft documents and presentation material for internal approval</p></li><li style=\"color%3A+rgb(0%2C+0%2C+0)%3B+font-style%3A+normal%3B+font-weight%3A+normal%3B\"><p>Provide presentations on IAEA Safety documents content in relation to site safety</p></li><li style=\"color%3A+rgb(0%2C+0%2C+0)%3B+font-style%3A+normal%3B+font-weight%3A+normal%3B\"><p>Contributions are expected to the following documents:</p><ul><li style=\"color%3A+rgb(0%2C+0%2C+0)%3B+font-style%3A+normal%3B+font-weight%3A+normal%3B\"><p>TECDOC and Benchmark Study on \"Probabilistic Fault Hazard Analysis\"</p></li><li style=\"color%3A+rgb(0%2C+0%2C+0)%3B+font-style%3A+normal%3B+font-weight%3A+normal%3B\"><p>TECDOC on Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Analysis: application of ergodic and non-ergodic approaches, use of geological observations for result constraining and updating</p></li></ul></li></ul><p><b>Knowledge, Skills and Abilities</b></p><ul style=\"margin-top%3A+0cm%3B\"><li>Site Safety</li><li>External Hazards Safety Assessment</li><li>Site Evaluation for Nuclear Installations</li></ul><p></p><p><b>Qualifications and Experience</b></p><ul style=\"margin-top%3A+0cm%3B\"><li>University degree in nuclear physics, geology or engineering</li><li style=\"margin%3A+0cm+0cm+0pt%3B+color%3A+rgb(0%2C+0%2C+0)%3B+line-height%3A+normal%3B+font-style%3A+normal%3B+font-weight%3A+normal%3B+mso-list%3A+l0+level1+lfo2%3B\">Minimum of 10 years of experience in hazard analysis.</li><li style=\"color%3A+rgb(0%2C+0%2C+0)%3B+font-style%3A+normal%3B+font-weight%3A+normal%3B\"><p>Minimum of five years of experience in project management in engineering.</p></li><li style=\"color%3A+rgb(0%2C+0%2C+0)%3B+font-style%3A+normal%3B+font-weight%3A+normal%3B\"><p>Knowledge of IAEA safety standards on external event hazard and design.</p></li><li style=\"color%3A+rgb(0%2C+0%2C+0)%3B+font-style%3A+normal%3B+font-weight%3A+normal%3B\"><p>Fluency in written and spoken English.
